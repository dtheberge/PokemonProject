Recreation of Pokemon Red/Blue within the constraints of the terminal with no GUI.
Primary Purpose: University of South Florida Object Oriented Programming C++ Project.

Based on the original Pokémon games, Red, Blue, and Yellow (First Generation). 

In Red/Blue/Yellow there are several aspects that require a map and/or are related to being able to visually see and interact with a GUI,
but these aspects will be removed ( such as moving around on a map or talking to NPC’s ). 

Instead, we will focus on the aspects that fall under any of the following: battling, finding items, buying items, selling items, and
encountering wild Pokémon.
